# fizzBuzz

Requirements:

Using only built-in filters and directives, create a template that implements Fizz Buzz.

Each number in numbers (1 to 100) should be printed to a line. If the number is divisible by 3 it should say “Fizz” next to it. If it's divisible by 5 it should say “Buzz” next to it. And if it is divisble by 3 and 5 then it should say "FizzBuzz" next to it.
